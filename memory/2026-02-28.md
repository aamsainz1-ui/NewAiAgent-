# 2026-02-28 — Dashboard Development & Agent Browser Setup

## Morning Session

### Agent Dashboard 3D — Major Development
- **Initial State:** 71 nodes → Expanded to 463 nodes
- **Multiple Versions Deployed:**
  - v3.0: Added Vector Data (88 nodes from 852 knowledge chunks)
  - v3.1: Added Sub-agents, Regional nodes, Tools, Traffic, Payments
  - v3.2: Added Safe Mode with auto-healing
  - v3.3: Fixed Links handling for D3 objects
  - v4.0: Added random initial positions, warmup ticks, node clustering
- **Final Structure (463 nodes):**
  - CORE: 4
  - AGENTS: 8
  - MODELS: 11
  - KNOWLEDGE: 7
  - SKILLS: 54
  - VECTOR DATA: 286
  - SUB-AGENTS: 15
  - REGIONAL: 42
  - TOOLS: 15
  - TRAFFIC: 12
  - PAYMENTS: 10

### Vercel Agent Browser Installation
- Installed `agent-browser` CLI globally
- Downloaded Chromium via `agent-browser install`
- Successfully tested: open, snapshot, screenshot, close commands
- Ready for automated web analysis

### UFAX9 Intel — Afternoon Round (07:03 UTC)
- **Status:** No new competitor activity detected
- **Channels Scanned:** 12 (Social, Influencer, Messaging, Forums)
- **Competitors Tracked:** 6 (UFABET, SBOBET, LSM99, GCLUB, Holiday Palace, Royal Online)
- **Assessment:** Saturday afternoon = low marketing activity (normal pattern)
- **Recommendation:** Monitor Evening round (post 18:00 Thai time)

### Dashboard Issues & Fixes
- **Problem:** Nodes array closed early (line 90), causing orphaned nodes
- **Solution:** Restructured gData object, validated all links
- **Cache Issues:** User experienced persistent cache on mobile/browser
- **Fix Applied:** Added version stamps (v4.0 FINAL), query parameter cache busting

## Key Learnings
- Safari mobile caching is aggressive — requires unique URL params for updates
- Force-graph-3D performance degrades with 400+ nodes on mobile
- Node clustering needed for better visualization at scale

## Active Links
- Dashboard: https://agent-brain-dashboard.vercel.app
- Agent Browser: Ready for use

## Late Morning Session (10:00-10:37 UTC)

### Agent Brain 3D Dashboard v5.1 - Major Bug Fixes
**Critical Fixes Deployed:**
1. **[Physics Bug]** Nodes exploding outward - Fixed by reducing repulsion force (-120 → -30), adding center force (0.05), increasing velocityDecay (0.3) and alphaDecay (0.05)
2. **[Overflow Bug]** Right panel cut off by screen edges - Fixed with max-height: calc(100vh - 220px) + overflow-y: auto
3. **[Jitter Bug]** Camera/node jitter when clicking - Fixed by pausing simulation during focus, using smooth lerp camera transition
4. **[Edge Alignment Bug]** Links not aligning with nodes - Force-graph auto-handles with linkDirectionalArrow added

**UX Improvements:**
- Marquee CSS animation for live activity ticker (infinite scroll)
- Grid layout (3 columns) for Cluster Filter buttons
- Color legend showing all 13 categories (bottom right)
- Loading progress bar with percentage indicator

**Visual Update:**
- Changed background to pure black (#000000) for cleaner look

**Git Commit:** 0f3bb41 - "v5.1: Fix all critical bugs - physics, overflow, jitter, layout, legend, loading"

### WebSocket Real-time Integration Planning
- Discussed options for connecting Dashboard to OpenClaw VPS
- Options: REST API polling, WebSocket persistent connection, Prometheus+Grafana
- Nathan selected WebSocket (option 2) for true real-time updates

**Next Steps:**
- Create WebSocket server on VPS (port 8080)
- Modify Dashboard to connect via WebSocket
- Stream metrics: token usage, active sessions, system health
